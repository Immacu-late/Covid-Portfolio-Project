🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
This project showcases my ability to explore, clean, and analyze real-world data using SQL Server. I worked with publicly available COVID-19 datasets from Our World in Data, focusing on drawing insights around infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress globally.

📊 Project Summary
The main objective of this project was to use SQL to explore key metrics of the COVID-19 pandemic, including:

-Infection and death rates per country and continent
-Percent of population infected or vaccinated
-Rolling totals of vaccination efforts
-Comparative insights across regions

🛠 Skills Used
-Joins
-Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
-Temp Tables
-Window Functions
-Aggregate Functions
-Data Type Conversion
-Views for Data Visualization

📁 Data Sources
CovidDeaths table: Contains daily death, case, and population data by location
CovidVaccinations table: Includes vaccination progress data by location and date

✅ How to Use
-Clone this repo
-Load the dataset into your local SQL Server
-Run the queries in sequence to explore the data and replicate the insights
