# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This project showcases my ability to explore, clean, and analyze real-world data using **SQL Server**.  
I worked with publicly available **COVID-19 datasets from Our World in Data**, focusing on drawing insights around infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress globally.

## 📊 Project Summary

The main objective of this project was to use SQL to explore key metrics of the COVID-19 pandemic, including:

- Infection and death rates per country and continent  
- Percent of population infected or vaccinated  
- Rolling totals of vaccination efforts  
- Comparative insights across regions

## 🛠 Skills Used

- Joins  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Temp Tables  
- Window Functions  
- Aggregate Functions  
- Data Type Conversion  
- Views for Data Visualization

## 📌 Project Features

- Calculated **Death Percentage** by country  
- Measured **Percent Population Infected**  
- Identified countries with **highest death or infection counts**  
- Created **rolling vaccination totals** using Window Functions  
- Used **CTEs, Temp Tables, and Views** for structured queries and reuse
